Ditch the stranger for the drinks aisle



[Ditch the stranger for the food aisle]
You're no doctor and you've done more than enough for the stranger.
Without remorse you hurry down the main food aisle as birds continue to crash through the ceiling. You pick up a discarded plastic shopping bag off the floor full of produce. You find a pretty stale baguette on a shelf, at a stretch it can be used as a weapon.

[Ditch the stranger for the drinks aisle]
You're no doctor and you've done more than enough for the stranger.
Without remorse you hurry down the main food aisle as birds continue to crash through the ceiling. Thankfully, the aisle provides more cover than the store enterance. You find a discarded plastic shopping bag and fill it with water and alchohol. You switch out vodka brands for the most premium, if the world is going to hell you might as well be picky. You spot a very large bottle of white whine. Holding it by the neck, at a stretch you think it can be used as a weapon.

[Stranger]
At the end of the aisle, a stranger is being visciously attacked by a crow.
His clothes are ripped and his arms are covered in scratches. 
The crow is using its feriously sharp claws to scratch at his face.
"Please!" he cries out "Help me!".
Help the stranger [baguette]
Help the stranger [wine bottle]
Don't help the stranger

[Don't help the stranger]
You stand and watch the bloody spectacle.
Eventually, he grabs hold of one of the crow's feet and slams it dead against a shelf.
"You could have bloody helped!!" he cries out and throws the mess of feathers at your feet.
He glares at you as he limps his way down the aisle towards the enterance. 
"It's worse down there" you chuckle to yourself.

Help the stranger [baguette]
You rush over, wait for an opening and swing the baguette as hard as you can.
It's a perfect hit! The baguette explodes and the crow hits the floor squarking.
It quickly recovers but the man it was attacking catches its foot under his.
You finish the job, visciously stamping on it's fragile head and you feel it give way underfoot. 
You stamp again for both good measure and to try and vent the frustations of the day.

Help the stranger [wine bottle]
You rush over, wait for an opening and swing the baguette as hard as you can.
It's a perfect hit! The bottle catches the crow perfectly and the crow hits the floor squarking.
Before the crow gets up you bring the wine bottle down on it. 
The red wine explodes over the bird, killing it immediatly.

"Thanks", the man slaps your shoulder.
"It just attacked me while I was shopping".
"Any idea what's going on?" you ask.
"No that bird came out of nowhere. All these birds.. Do they have a disease? 
"What has this store done? Or is this gouverment? Global warming? Brexit?!"
You respond with a shrug.
"I got to get out of here and find my kids"
Before you can say anything else the man turns away and limps quickly away towards the store enterance.   


[Ditch the stranger for the pharmaceutical aisle]
You're no doctor and you've done more than enough for the stranger.
Without remorse you hurry down the main food aisle as birds continue to crash through the ceiling. Thankfully, the aisle provides more cover than the store enterance. Going down the aisle, you find a discarded plastic shopping bag and fill it with useful medical supplies. A number of cough syrup bottles explode as a pigeon dives out from an adjecent aisle. Its wing is broken so there's nothing it can do except squawk and roll around wildly.

Kill the pigeon
Ignore it

[Kill the crow]
You visciously stamp on it's fragile head and you feel it give way underfoot. You stamp again for both good measure and to try and vent the frustations of the day. You wipe your foot on the store lamenent floor while looking at the remains in morbid curiosity.
[Continue]

The store enterance is chaos. Shoppers are desperate to re-open the metal shutter to escape the merciless bird attacks but you can hear the security guard yell back at them. Where the aisles break, you can see a man being attacked by a crow but he's too far away to help.

[Ignore]
The store enterance is chaos. Shoppers are desperate to re-open the metal shutter to escape the merciless bird attacks but you can hear the security guard yell back at them. You sidestep carefully around the crow. Where the aisles break, you can see a man being attacked by a seagull but he's too far away to help.
 
 Help Mary ------------------------
 
[Drag the wounded stranger to the pharmaceutical aisle]
As birds continue to crash through the ceiling you carefully pick your way to the stranger and hurry them down the pharmaceutical aisle. Thankfully, the aisle provides more cover than the store enterance. You sit the woman carefully against the aisle shelves. They are passing in and out of consiousness. 'What's your name you ask?'. 'Mary' they whisper weakly. 'Okay Mary, just hang on it there okay'. You say inspecting the wound.

Blood is everywhere. The wound looks bad it appears to be a bite along the forearm. You hope that you can recall some of the first aid training from that incredibly boring work seminar. 
[Call emergency services]
[Find painkillers]
[Try and stop the bleeding]

[Call emergency services]
You try and call emergency services but nobody picks up.
The bleeding is getting worse. You have to do something. 

[Find painkillers]
You frantically look and find ibuprofen. 
You place the pills in their mouth and offer a bottle of couch medicine to wash it down.
However, they have passed out probably from blood loss. You feel like you could have done a better job here. 
[Take Mary]
[Leave Mary]

[Try and stop the bleeding]
You look around the surrounding shelf for anything to help with the bleeding and find a long roll of gauze and some antiseptic tissues. You apply both to the wound but the blood seeps through.
[Raise the arm]
[Keep adding cloth and gauze to the material]
[Remove bloody cloth and replace with new material] 

[Raise the arm]
You raise the arm above their heart. 
You're fairly confident that's slowed down the bleeding somewhat.
[Keep adding cloth and gauze to the material]
[Remove bloody cloth and replace with new material] 

[Remove bloody cloth and replace with new material]
As you begin to undo the cloth the bleeding becomes worse.
[if arm not raised] By the time more gauze is applied they have lost consciousness. 
You feel like you could have done a better job here. 
[if leg raised] Seeing the situation worsen. You wrap the material back across the wound and apply pressure. Mary's is as pale as the white floor lamenent, you better not make any more mistakes.

[Keep adding cloth and gauze to the material]
Remembering fagments from the dull first aid seminar, you remember keep adding material on top of the old. A few minutes pass. The bleeding isn't stopping. You're running out of gauze. The birds are getting closer.
[Move Mary]
[Apply a tourniquet]

[Move Mary]
You move Mary slowly to her shoulder. Standing up carefully, Mary lets out a short groan. 
Before you take your first step, Mary falls away from you. 
It takes all your strength to stop her from crashing back into the shelving units.
Before you make another go of it, you realise Mary is out cold. 
[Move Mary]
[Leave Mary]

[Leave Mary]
You feel slightly bad leaving but surely the emergency services will be here soon.
You try to re-assure Mary but your not sure your words are getting through. 
You rest your hand on their good shoulder and then creep towards the end of the aisle. You find a discarded plastic shopping bag and fill it with painkillers and bandages. At the far side of the store, a man is being viciously attacked by a crow but like Mary you cannot help them without putting yourself in danger. Three more aisles lie a head of you.

You remove your belt. 'Okay Mary, we're applying a tounequet'.
Only after you've said the words does the panic of what you're about to do creep in.
'It'll be just like the movies' you say outloud re-assuring no one.
[Apply below the wound towards the hand]
[Apply below the wound towards the heart]

[Apply below the wound towards the hand]
You wrap the belt below the wound. 
It does absolutely nothing. If anything it increases the bleeding.
By the time you've got the belt off her wrist Mary seems to have passed out from the loss of blood.
[Move Mary]
[Leave Mary]

[Tighten the tourniquet]
You take off your belt and move the belt buckle on the highest notch. It's still pretty loose, so you jam a themonter between the buckle and twist making the belt tighter. The birds are getting closer, time is running out. You wrap the remaining gauze over Mary's wound and you find a discarded plastic shopping bag and fill it with painkillers and bandages.
[Move Mary]
[Leave Mary]

[Move Mary Consious]
Finding a discarded plastic shopping bag you fill it with painkillers and bandages. Next, you move Mary onto your shoulder. She groans. Still conscious, that's good. You carry her gently towards the end of the aisle. On the far side of the store, a man is being viciously attacked by a crow. Even if you wanted to put Mary down, he's too far to help. You have three more aisles in front of you. 

[Move Mary Unconscious]
Finding a discarded plastic shopping bag you fill it with painkillers and bandages.
Next, you move Mary onto your shoulder. Mary is limp and the full weight of their body falls on you. That's not good. You drag Mary as gently as you can with their good shoulder towards the end of the aisle. On the far side of the store, a man is being viciously attacked by a crow but you have your hands full and he's too far to help.

3 aisles ------------------------
Choose the hardware aisle
Choose the pet shop and food aisle
Choose a food aisle

Birds are zipping and crashing into products like bullets. 
Crouching low you swiftly cross over and enter the hardware aisle. 
The tall shelves again provide a small relief. 
Scanning the range of tools, you pick out a pretty meaty looking hammer.
It's got a long wooden handle which (after a few practice swings) gives it a decent amount of hitting power.
A nauseting realisation runs over you that you might have to use this on something soon.
Still, holding it in your hand feels good. It gives you a small boost in confidence.

You're not quite sure why you've entered the pet aisle all things considered.
Thankfully, they only stock fish and mice behind glass.
You peer into one glass case, a mouse sprints into the glass and instead of shying away, it keeps ramming the glass over and over again. Your transfixed, little flecks of blood rain on its white fur.
A splash of water wakes you from the trance, two tropical fish have lept out of there tanks and flapping wildly at your feet. Mouths gaping, there beady eyes staring up at you. You take a few cans of dog food. At a real stretch, it can be eaten as good.

You head down the second food aisle. You crouch past where the canapés are kept. 
'Leslie' you sigh. A pang of guilt strikes at your heart. 'God, I hope she's okay'.
You fill your plastic bag up with food you think will last. 
The police would have arrived by now if this type of attack only occured at the store.    
You find a discarded mop. At a strech, you think, this could be used as a weapon.


[But you have hammer or unbroken bottle of wine]
You head down the second food aisle. You crouch past where the canapés are kept. 
'Leslie' you sigh. A pang of guilt strikes at your heart. 'God, I hope she's okay'.
You fill your plastic bag up with food you think will last. 
The police would have arrived by now if this type of attack only occured at the store.    
You find a discarded mop. You feel the WEAPON is a better weapon.
